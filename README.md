# literacy-quiz

This is a simple quiz app, originally created to teach my son his alphabet. I adapted it to allow users to select from a list of quizzes or create their own custom quiz. I am taking suggestions for more quizzes as well as suggested features.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla & JQuery)
